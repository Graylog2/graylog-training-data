# ======================== OpenSearch Configuration =========================
#
# NOTE: OpenSearch comes with reasonable defaults for most settings.
#       Before you set out to tweak and tune the configuration, make sure you
#       understand what are you trying to accomplish and the consequences.
#
# The primary way of configuring a node is via this file. This template lists
# the most important settings you may want to configure for a production cluster.
#
# Please consult the documentation for further information on configuration options:
# https://www.opensearch.org
#
# ---------------------------------- Cluster -----------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for your cluster:
#
cluster.name: graylog
#
# ------------------------------------ Node ------------------------------------
#
# Use a descriptive name for the node:
#
node.name: ${STRIGO_RESOURCE_1_DNS}
#
# Add custom attributes to the node:
#
#node.attr.rack: r1
#
# ----------------------------------- Paths ------------------------------------
#
# Path to directory where to store the data (separate multiple locations by comma):
#
path.data: /var/lib/opensearch
#
# Path to log files:
#
path.logs: /var/log/opensearch
#
# ----------------------------------- Memory -----------------------------------
#
# Lock the memory on startup:
#
#bootstrap.memory_lock: true
#
# Make sure that the heap size is set to about half the memory available
# on the system and that the owner of the process is allowed to use this
# limit.
#
# OpenSearch performs poorly when the system is swapping the memory.
#
# ---------------------------------- Network -----------------------------------
#
# Set the bind address to a specific IP (IPv4 or IPv6):
#
network.host: 0.0.0.0
#
# Set a custom port for HTTP:
#
#http.port: 9200
#
# For more information, consult the network module documentation.
#
# --------------------------------- Discovery ----------------------------------
#
# Pass an initial list of hosts to perform discovery when this node is started:
# The default list of hosts is ["127.0.0.1", "[::1]"]
discovery.type: single-node
#discovery.seed_hosts: ["host1", "host2"]
#
# Bootstrap the cluster using an initial set of cluster-manager-eligible nodes:
#
#cluster.initial_cluster_manager_nodes: ["node-1", "node-2"]
#
# For more information, consult the discovery and cluster formation module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Gateway -----------------------------------
#
# Block initial recovery after a full cluster restart until N nodes are started:
#
#gateway.recover_after_nodes: 3
#
# For more information, consult the gateway module documentation.
#
# ---------------------------------- Various -----------------------------------
#
# Require explicit names when deleting indices:
action.auto_create_index: false
#action.destructive_requires_name: true
#
# ---------------------------------- Remote Store -----------------------------------
# Controls whether cluster imposes index creation only with remote store enabled
# cluster.remote_store.enabled: true
#
# Repository to use for segment upload while enforcing remote store for an index
# cluster.remote_store.repository: my-repo-1
#
# Controls whether cluster imposes index creation only with translog remote store enabled
# cluster.remote_store.translog.enabled: true
#
# Repository to use for translog upload while enforcing remote store for an index
# cluster.remote_store.translog.repository: my-repo-1
#
# ---------------------------------- Experimental Features -----------------------------------
#
# Gates the visibility of the experimental segment replication features until they are production ready.
#
#opensearch.experimental.feature.segment_replication_experimental.enabled: false
#
#
# Gates the visibility of the index setting that allows persisting data to remote store along with local disk.
# Once the feature is ready for production release, this feature flag can be removed.
#
#opensearch.experimental.feature.remote_store.enabled: false
#
#
# Gates the functionality of a new parameter to the snapshot restore API
# that allows for creation of a new index type that searches a snapshot
# directly in a remote repository without restoring all index data to disk
# ahead of time.
#
#opensearch.experimental.feature.searchable_snapshot.enabled: false
#
#
# Gates the functionality of enabling extensions to work with OpenSearch.
# This feature enables applications to extend features of OpenSearch outside of
# the core.
#
#opensearch.experimental.feature.extensions.enabled: false
#
#
# Gates the search pipeline feature. This feature enables configurable processors
# for search requests and search responses, similar to ingest pipelines.
#opensearch.experimental.feature.search_pipeline.enabled: false

plugins.security.disabled: true
