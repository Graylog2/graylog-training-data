The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop     running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service     during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,     and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the     scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system     administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /     prevention system that detected the scan.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library.

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and

The RDP client makes no effort to validate the identity of the server when setting up encryption. An attacker with the ability to intercept traffic from the RDP server can establish encryption with the client and server without being detected. A MiTM attack of this nature would allow the attacker to obtain any sensitive information transmitted, including authentication credentials.

This flaw exists because the RDP server stores a hardcoded RSA private key in the mstlsapi.dll library. Any local user with access to this file (on any Windows system) can retrieve the key and use it for this attack.","- Force the use of SSL as a transport layer for this service if supported, or/and

unresponsive.

There are several possible reasons for this :

  - The scan may have caused a service to freeze or stop
    running.

  - An administrator may have stopped a particular service
    during the scanning process.

This might be an availability problem related to the following :

  - A network outage has been experienced during the scan,
    and the remote network cannot be reached anymore by the
    scanner.

  - This scanner may has been blacklisted by the system
    administrator or by an automatic intrusion detection /
    prevention system that detected the scan.

  - The remote host is now down, either because a user
    turned it off during the scan or because a select denial
    of service was effective.

In any case, the audit of the remote host might be incomplete and may
need to be done again.",#NAME?,,"Port 9 was detected as being open but is now closed

login (and therefore act as a local user on the remote host).

different ways, each of which results in a break in the chain below

First, the top of the certificate chain sent by the server might not
be descended from a known public certificate authority.  This can
occur either when the top of the chain is an unrecognized, self-signed
certificate, or when intermediate certificates are missing that would
connect the top of the certificate chain to a known public certificate
authority. 

Second, the certificate chain may contain a certificate that is not
valid at the time of the scan.  This can occur either when the scan
occurs before one of the certificate's 'notBefore' dates, or after one
of the certificate's 'notAfter' dates. 

Third, the certificate chain may contain a signature that either
didn't match the certificate's information, or could not be verified.  
Bad signatures can be fixed by getting the certificate with
the bad signature to be re-signed by its issuer.  Signatures that
could not be verified are the result of the certificate's issuer using
a signing algorithm that Nessus either does not support or does not
recognize.

85582,,4.3,Medium,PrdOwner-TullyDesktop,tcp,2224,Web Application Potentially Vulnerable to Clickjacking,"The remote web server may fail to mitigate a class of web application
vulnerabilities.","The remote web server does not set an X-Frame-Options response header
or a Content-Security-Policy 'frame-ancestors' response header in all
content responses. This could potentially expose the site to a
clickjacking or UI redress attack, in which an attacker can trick a
user into clicking an area of the vulnerable page that is different
than what the user perceives the page to be. This can result in a user
performing fraudulent or malicious transactions.

X-Frame-Options has been proposed by Microsoft as a way to mitigate
clickjacking attacks and is currently supported by all major browser
vendors.

Content-Security-Policy (CSP) has been proposed by the W3C Web
Application Security Working Group, with increasing support among
all major browser vendors, as a way to mitigate clickjacking and other
attacks. The 'frame-ancestors' policy directive restricts which
sources can embed the protected resource.

Note that while the X-Frame-Options and Content-Security-Policy
response headers are not the only mitigations for clickjacking, they
are currently the most reliable methods that can be detected through
automation. Therefore, this plugin may produce false positives if
other mitigation strategies (e.g., frame-busting JavaScript) are
deployed or if the page does not perform any security-sensitive
transactions.","Return the X-Frame-Options or Content-Security-Policy (with the

OpenSSL 1.0.2 prior to 1.0.2i. It is, therefore, affected by the
following vulnerabilities :

  - Multiple integer overflow conditions exist in s3_srvr.c,
    ssl_sess.c, and t1_lib.c due to improper use of pointer
    arithmetic for heap-buffer boundary checks. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    cause a denial of service. (CVE-2016-2177)

  - An information disclosure vulnerability exists in the
    dsa_sign_setup() function in dsa_ossl.c due to a failure
    to properly ensure the use of constant-time operations.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via a timing side-channel attack, to disclose DSA key
    information. (CVE-2016-2178)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the DTLS
    implementation due to a failure to properly restrict the
    lifetime of queue entries associated with unused
    out-of-order messages. An unauthenticated, remote
    attacker can exploit this, by maintaining multiple
    crafted DTLS sessions simultaneously, to exhaust memory.
    (CVE-2016-2179)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the X.509 Public
    Key Infrastructure Time-Stamp Protocol (TSP)
    implementation. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can
    exploit this, via a crafted time-stamp file that is
    mishandled by the 'openssl ts' command, to cause 
    denial of service or to disclose sensitive information.
    (CVE-2016-2180)

  - A denial of service vulnerability exists in the
    Anti-Replay feature in the DTLS implementation due to
    improper handling of epoch sequence numbers in records.
    An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this,
    via spoofed DTLS records, to cause legitimate packets to
    be dropped. (CVE-2016-2181)

  - An overflow condition exists in the BN_bn2dec() function
    in bn_print.c due to improper validation of
    user-supplied input when handling BIGNUM values. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this to
    crash the process. (CVE-2016-2182)

  - A flaw exists in the tls_decrypt_ticket() function in
    t1_lib.c due to improper handling of ticket HMAC
    digests. An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit
    this, via a ticket that is too short, to crash the
    process, resulting in a denial of service.
    (CVE-2016-6302)

  - An integer overflow condition exists in the 
    MDC2_Update() function in mdc2dgst.c due to improper
    validation of user-supplied input. An unauthenticated,
    remote attacker can exploit this to cause a heap-based
    buffer overflow, resulting in a denial of service
    condition or possibly the execution of arbitrary code.
    (CVE-2016-6303)

  - A flaw exists in the ssl_parse_clienthello_tlsext()
    function in t1_lib.c due to improper handling of overly
    large OCSP Status Request extensions from clients. An
    unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this, via
    large OCSP Status Request extensions, to exhaust memory
    resources, resulting in a denial of service condition.
    (CVE-2016-6304)

  - An out-of-bounds read error exists in the certificate
    parser that allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker
    to cause a denial of service via crafted certificate
    operations. (CVE-2016-6306)

  - A flaw exists in the GOST ciphersuites due to the use of
    long-term keys to establish an encrypted connection. A
    man-in-the-middle attacker can exploit this, via a Key
    Compromise Impersonation (KCI) attack, to impersonate

in one or more cipher suites. It is, therefore, affected by a
vulnerability, known as SWEET32, due to the use of weak 64-bit block
ciphers. A man-in-the-middle attacker who has sufficient resources can
exploit this vulnerability, via a 'birthday' attack, to detect a
collision that leaks the XOR between the fixed secret and a known
plaintext, allowing the disclosure of the secret text, such as secure
HTTPS cookies, and possibly resulting in the hijacking of an
authenticated session.

Proof-of-concepts have shown that attackers can recover authentication
cookies from an HTTPS session in as little as 30 hours.","Reconfigure the affected application, if possible, to avoid use of all
